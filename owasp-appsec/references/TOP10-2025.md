# OWASP Top 10:2025 Detailed Reference

Comprehensive breakdown of each category with attack scenarios, detection patterns, and prevention strategies.

---

## A01:2025 - Broken Access Control

**Impact**: Unauthorized access to data or functionality. Users can act outside intended permissions.

**Related CWEs**: CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information), CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key)

### Attack Scenarios
- **IDOR**: Changing `user_id=123` to `user_id=456` in URL to access another user's data
- **Forced browsing**: Accessing `/admin` without admin role
- **Privilege escalation**: Modifying JWT role claim from "user" to "admin"
- **Path traversal**: Using `../` to access files outside intended directory

### Detection Patterns
```
# Look for:
- Direct object references without authorization checks
- Missing role/permission validation before operations
- Client-controlled IDs used directly in queries
- Directory listing enabled
- JWT claims trusted without server validation
```

### Prevention
- Deny by default (except public resources)
- Implement access control once, reuse throughout application
- Enforce record ownership - users can only access their own data
- Disable directory listing, remove sensitive files from webroot
- Log access control failures, alert on repeated failures
- Rate limit API access to minimize automated attack damage

## A02:2025 - Security Misconfiguration

**Impact**: System compromise through unnecessary features, default credentials, or overly verbose errors.

**Related CWEs**: CWE-16 (Configuration), CWE-611 (XXE), CWE-1004 (Sensitive Cookie Without HttpOnly)

### Attack Scenarios
- **Default credentials**: Admin panels with `admin:admin` or `root:password`
- **Stack traces in errors**: Exception details reveal framework, paths, queries
- **Unnecessary features**: Debug endpoints, sample applications left enabled
- **Missing security headers**: No CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options

### Detection Patterns
```
# Look for:
- Default credentials in config files
- Debug/development mode enabled in production
- Verbose error messages returned to clients
- Missing security headers in responses
- Unnecessary HTTP methods enabled (TRACE, OPTIONS open)
- Cloud storage buckets with public access
```

### Prevention
- Automated hardening process for deployments
- Minimal platform - remove unused features, frameworks, components
- Review and update configurations for security notes/updates
- Segmented architecture between components
- Send security directives via headers (CSP, HSTS)
- Automated verification of configuration effectiveness

## A03:2025 - Software Supply Chain Failures

**Impact**: Compromise through vulnerable dependencies, malicious packages, or insecure build pipelines.

**Related CWEs**: CWE-829 (Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere), CWE-1104 (Use of Unmaintained Third Party Components)

### Attack Scenarios
- **Typosquatting**: Installing `lod-ash` instead of `lodash`
- **Dependency confusion**: Private package name hijacked on public registry
- **Compromised maintainer**: Legitimate package updated with malicious code
- **Outdated dependencies**: Using library with known CVEs

### Detection Patterns
```
# Look for:
- Dependencies without lockfiles (package-lock.json, yarn.lock)
- Outdated packages with known vulnerabilities
- Dependencies from unverified sources
- Missing integrity checks (no subresource integrity)
- Build scripts that download arbitrary code
```

### Prevention
- Maintain inventory of all components and versions
- Remove unused dependencies, features, files
- Continuously monitor CVE databases (npm audit, Snyk, Dependabot)
- Obtain components only from official, verified sources
- Use lockfiles and verify integrity hashes
- Monitor for unmaintained libraries without security patches

## A04:2025 - Cryptographic Failures

**Impact**: Exposure of sensitive data through weak or missing encryption.

**Related CWEs**: CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password), CWE-327 (Use of Broken Crypto Algorithm), CWE-328 (Reversible One-Way Hash), CWE-331 (Insufficient Entropy)

### Attack Scenarios
- **Weak hashing**: MD5/SHA1 for passwords allows rainbow table attacks
- **Missing TLS**: Credentials transmitted in plaintext
- **Hardcoded keys**: Encryption key in source code, leaked via VCS
- **Weak random**: Predictable session IDs or tokens

### Detection Patterns
```
# Look for:
- MD5, SHA1 used for password hashing
- Hardcoded keys, secrets, or passwords
- Missing TLS for sensitive data transmission
- Deprecated algorithms (DES, 3DES, RC4, RSA-1024)
- Math.random() or similar for security purposes
- Missing padding in block ciphers
```

### Prevention
- Classify data by sensitivity, apply controls accordingly
- Don't store sensitive data unnecessarily - discard ASAP
- Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- Use strong algorithms: AES-256-GCM, RSA-2048+, SHA-256+
- Use Argon2id, bcrypt, scrypt for password hashing
- Generate keys with cryptographically secure random generators
- Avoid deprecated protocols (SSL, TLS 1.0/1.1)

## A05:2025 - Injection

**Impact**: Arbitrary code or command execution through unsanitized input.

**Related CWEs**: CWE-79 (XSS), CWE-89 (SQL Injection), CWE-94 (Code Injection), CWE-78 (OS Command Injection)

### Attack Scenarios
- **SQL Injection**: `' OR '1'='1` bypasses authentication
- **Command Injection**: `; rm -rf /` in filename parameter
- **LDAP Injection**: `*)(uid=*))(|(uid=*` extracts all users
- **XPath Injection**: `' or '1'='1` in XML query

### Detection Patterns
```
# Look for:
- String concatenation in SQL/LDAP/XPath queries
- User input passed to system commands (exec, spawn, system)
- eval() or similar with user-controlled data
- Template injection with user input
- Missing parameterization in database queries
```

### Prevention
- Use parameterized queries / prepared statements exclusively
- Use allowlist input validation for all user input
- Escape special characters when parameterization not possible
- Use LIMIT and other controls to prevent mass disclosure
- Avoid dynamic queries - use stored procedures where possible
- Never pass user input to command interpreters

## A06:2025 - Insecure Design

**Impact**: Fundamental design flaws that cannot be fixed by implementation alone.

**Related CWEs**: CWE-209 (Error Message Information Leak), CWE-256 (Unprotected Storage of Credentials), CWE-501 (Trust Boundary Violation)

### Attack Scenarios
- **Missing rate limiting**: Unlimited password attempts enable brute force
- **No business logic validation**: Negative quantities in shopping cart
- **Insufficient isolation**: Tenant A can access Tenant B's data
- **Missing threat modeling**: Attack vectors not considered in design

### Detection Patterns
```
# Look for:
- Missing rate limiting on sensitive operations
- Business logic that trusts client-side validation
- No separation between tenants/users at design level
- Lack of security requirements documentation
- Missing abuse cases in user stories
```

### Prevention
- Establish secure development lifecycle with security specialists
- Use threat modeling for authentication, access control, business logic
- Create reference architecture with security patterns
- Write security requirements and constraints into user stories
- Unit and integration test all critical flows with abuse cases
- Segregate tenants at all tiers

## A07:2025 - Authentication Failures

**Impact**: Identity compromise through weak credentials, session management, or authentication bypass.

**Related CWEs**: CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-384 (Session Fixation), CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration)

### Attack Scenarios
- **Credential stuffing**: Using leaked credentials from other breaches
- **Brute force**: Automated password guessing
- **Session fixation**: Attacker sets victim's session ID before login
- **Weak password recovery**: Security questions easily guessed

### Detection Patterns
```
# Look for:
- No rate limiting on login attempts
- Weak password requirements (< 8 chars, no complexity)
- Session ID doesn't change after login
- Remember me tokens that never expire
- Password in URL or logs
- Missing MFA for sensitive operations
```

### Prevention
- Implement MFA where possible
- Never ship with default credentials
- Check passwords against known breached password lists
- Align password requirements with NIST 800-63b (length > complexity)
- Harden against credential stuffing with rate limiting and CAPTCHA
- Regenerate session ID after successful login
- Use secure, random session IDs with proper expiration

## A08:2025 - Software and Data Integrity Failures

**Impact**: Code or data modification through unsigned updates, unsafe deserialization, or CI/CD compromise.

**Related CWEs**: CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity), CWE-494 (Download of Code Without Integrity Check), CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data)

### Attack Scenarios
- **Unsigned updates**: Malicious update pushed without verification
- **Unsafe deserialization**: Object injection leading to RCE
- **CI/CD poisoning**: Build pipeline compromise injects backdoors
- **CDN compromise**: Third-party scripts modified to steal data

### Detection Patterns
```
# Look for:
- Auto-updates without signature verification
- Deserialization of untrusted data (pickle, unserialize, readObject)
- CI/CD pipelines without integrity verification
- Third-party resources without SRI hashes
- Insecure configuration of CI/CD tools
```

### Prevention
- Use digital signatures to verify software/data integrity
- Ensure CI/CD pipeline has proper access control and integrity
- Don't send serialized objects to untrusted clients
- Implement integrity checks on deserialized data
- Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for third-party resources
- Review code and configuration changes to minimize malicious injection

## A09:2025 - Security Logging and Alerting Failures

**Impact**: Breaches go undetected, evidence unavailable for forensics.

**Related CWEs**: CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs), CWE-223 (Omission of Security-relevant Information), CWE-778 (Insufficient Logging)

### Attack Scenarios
- **No login logging**: Brute force attacks undetected
- **Log injection**: Attacker inserts false log entries
- **Missing audit trail**: Cannot determine what data was accessed
- **Logs not monitored**: Alerts not configured or ignored

### Detection Patterns
```
# Look for:
- Failed logins not logged
- Access control failures not logged
- No alerting for suspicious activity
- Logs only stored locally (lost on compromise)
- User input logged without sanitization
- Missing timestamps or user context in logs
```

### Prevention
- Log all authentication, access control, and input validation failures
- Log with sufficient context to identify suspicious accounts
- Encode/sanitize log data to prevent injection
- Ensure logs have audit trail for high-value transactions
- Establish effective monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity
- Use SIEM or similar for log aggregation and analysis
- Create incident response plan

## A10:2025 - Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions

**Impact**: Information disclosure, denial of service, or undefined behavior through poor error handling.

**Related CWEs**: CWE-209 (Error Message Information Leak), CWE-390 (Detection of Error Condition Without Action), CWE-754 (Improper Check for Unusual Conditions)

### Attack Scenarios
- **Stack traces**: Full exception details reveal internals
- **Unhandled exceptions**: Application crashes exposing state
- **Error-based enumeration**: Different errors for valid vs invalid users
- **Resource exhaustion**: No cleanup on error leads to DoS

### Detection Patterns
```
# Look for:
- Detailed error messages returned to users
- Unhandled exceptions in critical paths
- Different error responses for valid vs invalid inputs
- Missing resource cleanup in error handlers
- Empty catch blocks that swallow exceptions
- Error messages containing file paths, SQL, or stack traces
```

### Prevention
- Return generic error messages to users
- Log detailed errors server-side only
- Ensure consistent error responses (timing, content) to prevent enumeration
- Clean up resources in finally blocks or equivalent
- Never expose internal error details, stack traces, or debug info
- Test error handling paths explicitly
- Implement global exception handlers as safety net
